# PM Personal Notes

## Key Steps of Product Development
Research & Plans => Design => Implement & Test => Release  
- Objectives and Results  
- Goals, Use Cases, Requirements, Wireframes, Security
- Dogfood, find ways to test yourself  
- Checklist for approvals, stakeholder, make sure that right resource for post-release.

## Interview
### Estimation, Ferma Questions
1. Scope the problems, ask the assmuptions, define problem.
2. Break down and Structurize, list alternative approaches. Objects -> components, estimate small parts then sum together.
3. Estimate using facts you know, give boundaries with each method of estimation and compare them! List assumptions.
4. Summary: overestimate, underestimate. Missing factors if more time provided, what assumptions could factor significantly.

Be neutral in over/underestimate to reduce consistent bias. WLLN gives the LC of estimates yields smaller variance than one guess.

We need to calculate the road density of a square mile. Let’s imagine a square mile of the US, and, on average, across cities and rural environments, we can guess that there might be around 2 miles of road per square mile. Why is this?

It’s reasonable to imagine that there’s a road crossing across both the length and height of the square mile. Of course, in rural environments there may be no roads at all, but in cities and even small towns, there will be much more road. On average, this could be a fair estimate.

Engagnement: Frequency of use  
Referral/Retention: how often refer, 
Revenue/Cost: how to generate revenue/how much, development/maintaineance cost

#### Product Analysis
1. What does it solve, how it helps users. Who's targetted. Why it is good/bad for clients.
2. Who are the competitors, strength/weakness.

#### Design Steps
1. The Ask:  
  What's the goal? Who's the target? Specification on users, context, type of product(device) and budget/limitations/timeline.
2. The Clarification:
  Write down the target client/market. Clarify your assumptions. Identify competitors, similar products, their S/W, improvements.
3. The Structure:
  List down different solutions, SW/Constraint analysis, alignment with the goal. Tackle the apparent best way and provide structure.
4. The Solution: 
  Consider a typical case with an average user. Build a story context for the MVP.
5. The Agile:
  Add edge cases, further potential use case, further improvements, think agile. 

### Behavioural
Products: Products or features that the company creates? How do the
products fit with each other?  
Competitors: Who are the competitors? How does the company differentiate itself from them?  
Customers/Market: Target Market of Company, suggest secondary market.  
Revenue: How does the company make money? How to make more money?  
Love and Hate: How do customers feel about the product? What are the most common complaints and issues?  
Metrics: If possible, try to learn about the company’s key metrics. Finding exact numbers might
be difficult, but you can at least get an understanding of which metrics they’re doing well on and
which ones they’re struggling with. How many users does it have? What is its conversion rate?
What is its growth rate?
News and Rumors: Have there been any interesting news reports about the company? What is
the company rumored to do? Don’t just read this stuff. Formulate an opinion on it.

What do you find most challenging about being a PM here?  
Where do you see the company going in five years?  
What would make someone the ideal PM candidate for you?  

“I’m often not very detail oriented. While this has some benefits, particularly in an
entrepreneurial environment by helping me move faster, it also means I’ve made some
embarrassing mistakes in the past. I’ve developed a good sense though of the types of situations
where I’m likely to make mistakes, and I double or triple check my work in those cases.  


## Google Tricks
That awesome side project you did, when combined with strong performance on an analytical question, could be what you need to get a “strong hire” recommendation. If there’s some aspect of your background that you want to be sure the hiring committee knows, mix that into multiple interviews.  
This will greatly improve the odds that the committee knows about it.
Google loves questions about its own products: Which ones do you love? Which ones would you do
differently? Be prepared to talk in detail about some Google products.
Google also asks a lot of estimation questions and technical questions. Be sure to brush up on both
your quantitative skills and your technical skills. Don’t be surprised if you’re asked to write a bit of
code on the whiteboard.
Estimation questions will often involve some aspects of Google products, and one of the big areas
there is advertising. Pay special attention to the questions related to advertising in the case study
chapter.
