## Google Tricks
That awesome side project you did, when combined with 
strong performance on an analytical question, could be what you need to get a “strong hire”
recommendation. If there’s some aspect of your
background that you want to be sure the hiring committee knows, mix that into multiple interviews.
This will greatly improve the odds that the committee knows about it.
Google loves questions about its own products: Which ones do you love? Which ones would you do
differently? Be prepared to talk in detail about some Google products.
Google also asks a lot of estimation questions and technical questions. Be sure to brush up on both
your quantitative skills and your technical skills. Don’t be surprised if you’re asked to write a bit of
code on the whiteboard.
Estimation questions will often involve some aspects of Google products, and one of the big areas
there is advertising. Pay special attention to the questions related to advertising in the case study
chapter.

### Preperation
Products: Products or features that the company creates? How do the
products fit with each other?  
Competitors: Who are the competitors? How does the company differentiate itself from them?  
Customers/Market: Target Market of Company, suggest secondary market.  
Revenue: How does the company make money? How to make more money?  
Love and Hate: How do customers feel about the product? What are the most common complaints and issues?  
Metrics: If possible, try to learn about the company’s key metrics. Finding exact numbers might
be difficult, but you can at least get an understanding of which metrics they’re doing well on and
which ones they’re struggling with. How many users does it have? What is its conversion rate?
What is its growth rate?
News and Rumors: Have there been any interesting news reports about the company? What is
the company rumored to do? Don’t just read this stuff. Formulate an opinion on it.
